    Absence data and analysis: The solution registers attendance, whether at school or from home online, and at the end of the day there's a multiple choice test.
    The data per student can be distributed to the student's guardians while the aggregated data can be sent from school. In this way the guardians can keep an eye 
    on their children, and the schools can use analyses to find out why dropout happens on a structural level.The school will then easily be able to implement the right measures based on this information that the app provides.
    <br>
    The data that the app will collect is:
    <ul>
      <li>School</li>
      <li>Class</li>
      <li>Number of students attending</li>
      <li>Absence separated by sex</li>
      <li>Cause of absence (i.e. sickness, bullying, mental health, problems at home, economical problems</li>
  </ul>
