    Absence data and analysis: The app registers attendance (either at school or online),
    and at the end of the day a multiple choice test is carried out. The data per student can be distributed to the student's parents,
    while the aggregated data can be sent to the school. In this way, parents can keep an eye on their children,
    Schools can use analysis to find out how dropouts occur at a more structural level.
    The school will then easily be able to implement the right measures based on this information that the app provides.

    The data that the application will record is:
    School, class, number of students who have attended, gender distribution of absences, test performance,
    cause of absence (eg illness, bullying, mental health, problems at home, financial problems).
