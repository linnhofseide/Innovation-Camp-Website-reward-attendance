	<h1>Innovation Camp - Reward Attendance</h1>
	<p class="startside">
		
Not every child has a positive relationship with school at a young age, and in some countries there are many students who drop out of school early.
If the child drops out early this is something that can have significant negative consequences for both the individual child and the economy of the society it lives in.
Our goal is to turn around this trend by engaging children to get better school attendance. 
<br><br>
Our solution is based on the principles that a reward system will lead to more engagement in the classroom. 
If we combine this with more collection of data surrounding absence and causes of absence we can motivate children to stay in school while simultaneously detecting the students that are in the process of dropping out.
